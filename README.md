#AI Experiments
I've been working with Claude Code and Copilot on code work. This repo has a few of those experiments. I shall endeavor to keep all of them separate for playing.

A bit of writing on this, mostly me, but perhaps some AI, is contained on my blog with [the AIExperiments tag](https://voiceofthedba.com/tag/aiexperiments/).

## TDM Log Analyzer
In the TDM folder, I asked Claude Code to help me analyze TDM log files from a machine. I copied my logs from ProgramData (documented [here](https://documentation.red-gate.com/testdatamanager/troubleshooting/log-files)) into subfolders and then asked for the AI to build a way to analyze these. It produced the python script, which also generated charts and exported the CSV.
